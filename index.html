        Yellow! I'm working on this locally atm. I'm looking forward to creating
        an archive of some of my tech wizardry as I work through my backlog of
        maker projects and it'd be nice to have a virtual space to record some
        of my Warhammer homebrews too!

        If you're so inclined you can see how it's going on my
        <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/milocollins/neocities-tekmage-milo"
          >Github</a
        >. I'm using Vite to build the site and will publish my main branch dist
        here as it comes along. As a Web Developer professionaly, this is a bit
        of my bread and butter, so I'll endeavour to share a bit of my process
        as I go with some Devlogs.
